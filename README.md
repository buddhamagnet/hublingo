## HUBLINGO ##

A fun project to retrieve the favourite languages of Github users.

Use inside your favourite Rails/Sinatra/Rack application.

You can also use the gem in irb/pry as follows:

```ruby
require 'hublingo'
hub = Hublingo.new
hub.lingo('buddhamagnet')
```

NOTES:

This whole project, the gem and application, was completed in 3 1/2 hours.

I published it as a gem for giggles only.
